# Samples 

## YOLO Bounding Box Prediction for Self-Driving

*Sample prediction for Self-Driving Image*

## Image Segmentation with U-Net
![Image Segmentation Example](/images/segmentation.png)
*Sample prediction for Image Segmentation. Note the training epochs were limited, so accuracy is limited by training time rather than model*

## Neural Style Transfer

![Neural Style Transfer Epoch 200000](/images/styletransferHE.png)
*Nerual Style Transfer example. The image is regenerated by capturing the style of the style photo. The first epoch is the result after 2500 epochs. The one after is after around 200000 epochs.*
